## Instructions of how to get access to my project files.
- 1. I uploaded all files about my 5216 assignment on my Github repository, and the website is [Zhiliang's 5216assignment](https://github.com/frisokaiyu/comp5216-quiz-game-app-zwan4387);
- 2. Two methods to get my files online:
- 1) To use command line ('Zsh' or 'Terminal') to download all files in github. Type in **"git clone https://github.com/frisokaiyu/5216assignment"**, you will get all documents about this assignemnt, and type in **" git clone https://github.com/frisokaiyu/comp5216-quiz-game-app-zwan4387"**, you will get all source code as well.
If you do not know how to use git commands, you can follow the tutorial of [Gitbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/);
- 2) To copy "https://github.com/frisokaiyu/5216assignment" and "https://github.com/frisokaiyu/comp5216-quiz-game-app-zwan4387" one by one in your web browser, and click **"clone or download"** button and save it in your computer;
- 3. I have created three folders whose names are **"Assignment report"**, **"Introduction vedio"**, **"Presentation notes"** in **5216assignment** repository for storing documents and one folder named **"Quiz Game App"** in **comp5216-quiz-game-app-zwan4387** repository for storing source code.
- 4. Enter into each folder, and you can get what you want.
- 5. If you want to run my project on your computer, the only thing you have to do is use my Podfile to install Facebook framework. I have finished Podfile in my project, you could use command line tools to enter into my root directory and type **'pod install'** to install everything.
- 6. After all preparation finished, double click 'Quiz Game.xcworkspace' but **do not double click** 'Quiz Game.xcodeproj' mistakenly.
